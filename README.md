# 🕵‍♂ Wireshark-Network-Capture
Live network traffic capture and protocol analysis using Wireshark

## 📌 Objective

Capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify basic network protocols and traffic types.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- *Wireshark* (version 4.4.7)
- Operating System: Windows
- Browser: Chrome
- Command Prompt (ping utility)

---

## 📋 Task Overview

This project involved capturing live network traffic from a local machine, analyzing the traffic using Wireshark filters, identifying common network protocols, and exporting the results into a .pcap file for further analysis.

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi) for traffic monitoring.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and using ping google.com in CMD.
4. Captured live packets for approximately 1–2 minutes.
5. Stopped the capture and used filters to analyze:
   - http
   - dns
   - tcp
6. Identified the following key protocols in the captured packets:
   - *DNS*: Domain name resolution
   - *HTTP*: Website traffic
   - *TCP*: Reliable transport protocol
7. Saved the capture as a .pcap file (Networks_Captured.pcap).
8. Created a short report based on the findings.

## 📈 Outcome

This task provided hands-on experience with network analysis tools. It helped develop an understanding of how internet traffic flows and how different protocols interact in a live environment.
